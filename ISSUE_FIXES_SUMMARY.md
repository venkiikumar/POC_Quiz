# Quiz Application Issues Fixed - August 13, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Questions showing "Option not available"**
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to transform question data incorrectly
**Root Cause**: The server returns questions in format `{question, options: {A, B, C, D}, correct}` but frontend was trying to transform them to `{question, optionA, optionB, optionC, optionD, correctAnswer}`
**Fix**: Removed the unnecessary data transformation in `script.js` - line 473-481

### 2. **All 25 questions were the same**
**Problem**: Related to the above transformation issue
**Root Cause**: The incorrect transformation was corrupting the question data
**Fix**: Questions are now used directly as returned from server without transformation

### 3. **User results not being stored**
**Problem**: Server endpoint was only returning success message without storing data
**Root Cause**: The `/api/quiz-results` endpoint was just returning `{success: true}` without saving data
**Fix**: 
- Added in-memory storage array `quizResults = []`
- Updated POST `/api/quiz-results` to actually store the submitted data
- Added GET `/api/quiz-results` endpoint to view stored results
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Technical Changes Made

### Frontend (script.js)
```javascript
// REMOVED this incorrect transformation:
this.questions = this.questions.map(q => ({
    question: q.question,
    optionA: q.option_a,
    optionB: q.option_b, 
    optionC: q.option_c,
    optionD: q.option_d,
    correctAnswer: q.correct_answer
}));

// REPLACED with:
// Questions are already in the correct format from the server
// No transformation needed as server returns: { question, options: {A, B, C, D}, correct }
```

### Backend (server-minimal.js)
```javascript
// ADDED in-memory storage
const quizResults = [];

// UPDATED results endpoint to actually store data
app.post('/api/quiz-results', (req, res) => {
    try {
        const result = {
            id: quizResults.length + 1,
            ...req.body,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        };
        
        quizResults.push(result);
        
        console.log(`💾 Quiz result saved for ${result.name} (${result.email})`);
        console.log(`📊 Score: ${result.score}/${result.totalQuestions} (${result.percentage}%) - Time: ${result.timeTaken}s`);
        
        res.json({ 
            success: true, 
            message: 'Result saved successfully',
            id: result.id
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('❌ Error saving quiz result:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ 
            success: false, 
            message: 'Failed to save result' 
        });
    }
});

// ADDED endpoint to view results
app.get('/api/quiz-results', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        total: quizResults.length,
        results: quizResults
    });
});
```

## Verification Results

### Local Testing Completed ✅
1. **Questions Display**: Different questions with proper options showing for each application
2. **Question Variety**: All 25 questions are different and properly shuffled
3. **Results Storage**: Quiz submissions are now properly stored in memory with timestamps
4. **Multiple Applications**: Each application (RoadOps=Java, RoadSales=C#, UES=Python, Digital=TypeScript) shows different question sets

### Test Results:
- **RoadOps (Java)**: Returns Java programming questions
- **RoadSales (C#)**: Returns C# programming questions  
- **UES (Python)**: Returns Python programming questions
- **Digital (TypeScript)**: Returns TypeScript programming questions
- **Results Storage**: Tested POST to `/api/quiz-results` - data stored successfully
- **Results Retrieval**: GET `/api/quiz-results` returns all stored results with timestamps

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Azure**: Push the updated code to Azure App Service
2. **Test in Production**: Verify all fixes work in Azure environment
3. **Optional Enhancement**: Implement persistent database storage for results (current solution uses in-memory storage which resets on server restart)

## Files Modified

- `script.js` - Fixed question data handling
- `server-minimal.js` - Added proper results storage functionality

The application is now ready for Azure deployment and should work correctly with:
- ✅ Proper question display with all options
- ✅ Different questions for each application
- ✅ Proper result storage and retrieval
